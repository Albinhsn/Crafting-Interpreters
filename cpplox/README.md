## TODO


Fix so we don't leak memory on runtimeError

Store struct somewhere else so it doesn't get removed after first use, aka a table of structs to refer to them

Change stack -> vec/std::stack?

Change how memory is handled

Support arrays, maps

Test suite

Aggressively refactor to minimize code 

tabs/spaces > {}
